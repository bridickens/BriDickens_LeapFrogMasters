Unity 5 Assignment - 02/18/2024

The iterations I made were from playing with my younger brother and my friend. We experienced issues with the jumps being too high, so we had to mess with the box colliders and the jumps themselves. Another issue I ran into was the arena being too short, which meant the players could both purposefully and accidentally jump out of the arena. I made sure to make the wall high enough in that regard as well. For the game design tool that I added, it was a constraint, specifically a time constraint. The players have 30 seconds until a game over screen pops up at them, which means they can play again.

 For this assignment, I added GUI for the two player scores as well as two scenes that play if one of the characters get to 5 points.

Unity 7 Assignment - 03/03/2024

For this assignment, I added in a tree with physics that the players can push in. I also added the a game state manager and changed my scoring to go through the manager and not the previous way. I added collectible items and an inventory system as well.

Unity 8 Assignment - 03/10/2024

Today I implemented a couple fun mechanics! First, I did a split screen so that each player would have their own respective screen. Another thing I added was a speed boost, which is achieved by grabbing the collectible items from last week's assignment. I changed the arena to make it more race-like and kept the 'jumping over one another' mechanic in order to keep scoring similar. My timer is still there just in case neither player gets to the end before it ends.
