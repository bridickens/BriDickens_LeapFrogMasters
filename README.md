Unity 5 Assignment - 02/18/2024

The iterations I made were from playing with my younger brother and my friend. We experienced issues with the jumps being too high, so we had to mess with the box colliders and the jumps themselves. Another issue I ran into was the arena being too short, which meant the players could both purposefully and accidentally jump out of the arena. I made sure to make the wall high enough in that regard as well. For the game design tool that I added, it was a constraint, specifically a time constraint. The players have 30 seconds until a game over screen pops up at them, which means they can play again.
